        Comfortable to Use &amp; Built to Last. The Hand Grater has a
          razor-sharp stainless steel blade that won&apos;t rust and a
          comfortable, non-slip handle. Its unique curved sides make
          it extremely rigid and allow you to apply more force
          when it&apos;s needed.

        Save Space in The Kitchen And Drawer. Replace your bulky, unsafe,
          and hard-to-clean box grater, cheese grater electric, cheese grater
          with container or heavy electric food processor with a single Deiss
          Classic Zester Grater &amp; Food Shredder. The metal parmesan cheese
          grater teeth won't clog up the way other graters for kitchen do, so
          it's a snap to clean. Just pass your cheese grader under running
        water.

          cheeses such as parmesan, you&apos;ll get a nice pile of grated
          cheese that melts almost instantly on hot pasta.
