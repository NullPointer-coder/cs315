    <h2>About this item:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        (Doesn't work with MagSafe charger) BE AWARE OF THE LIMITATION: This
          is a USB-C female to USB-A male adapter designed for charging or 
          data transfer and it will NOT support vidoe signal transmission. 
          (Latest Test Result: This product doesn't work with MagSafe 
          wireless charger due to the incompatibility of charging protocols. 
          So MagSafe charger must be paired with A USB-C power adapter).
      </li>
      <li>
        With this little dongle plugged into an available standard USB port, 
          your legacy devices (charger, power bank, computer) can turn into a
          USB-C enabled platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can easily hook up any USB-C peripherals (USB Type-C cable, 
          USB Type-C flash drive, USB Type-C hub) that make use of the newer 
          USB-C connector.
      </li>
      <li>
        This adapter offers data transfer speeds of up to 480 Mbps between 
          connected devices and also supports up to 2 Amps of power output 
          for charging your devices. Enjoy the fast and safe charging.

      <li>
        Our aluminum-alloy-bodied dongle occupies very little space and can 
          plug directly onto the end of your USB-A hardware, so you would not
          have to worry about carrying it around.
